# Quick Theme Creation

Quick branding allows you to change several themes and immediately get a result you can start working with or optimize further. To do this, you only need to set a few colors, and everything will be applied to the necessary controls in the right places. Then, you need to repeat this step for all supported themes, and you're done.

### Before You Start

1. We recommend downloading the latest version of the Figma library.
2. Settings are configured in the variables interface. You need to open the Color Styles collection and select the Branding group:

   ![Branding](/static/images/design/Branding/Branding.png)

3. It's convenient to view the results on the Branding page in Figma. This page contains components that use brand variables, which will give you an initial idea of how everything will look in the end.
4. Color styles must be used in components.
5. The value of each color style is the corresponding variable.

### 1. Basic Brand Colors

**--g-color-base-background**

The background color of the page. For a light theme, white is most often used, but any other color can also be used. For a dark theme, there is a wider choice of colors: from neutral gray shades to warm or cool colors.

**--g-color-base-brand**

The primary brand color. Background for the main button, checkbox, radio button, toggle switch, and also the special tooltip theme.

**--g-color-base-brand-hover**

Hover color for the primary brand color. We use a darker shade, but a lighter shade or a completely different color is also acceptable.

**--g-color-base-brand-selection**

Backgrounds for elements with the "selected" semantic:

![Selection](/static/images/design/Branding/Selection.png)

**--g-color-base-brand-selection-hover**

Hover color for selected elements. Not frequently used in typical tasks, more often used when preparing all states for a new component or in prototypes.

**--g-color-line-brand**

Brand color lines. Selected state in cards and tabs, as well as the spinner color.

![Lines](/static/images/design/Branding/Lines.png)

**--g-color-text-brand**

Brand color text when used without backgrounds.

![Text](/static/images/design/Branding/Text.png)

Here's the translated design guide source file:

**--g-color-text-brand-heavy**

Brand color text on top of backgrounds. Helps compensate for contrast loss when using backgrounds.

![Text Heavy](/static/images/design/Branding/Heavy.png)

**--g-color-text-brand-contrast**

After you've chosen a color for branding primary controls, you need to select a contrasting color for it. The contrast must be maintained across all used themes.

If the brand color doesn't fundamentally change its brightness when switching themes, you can try colors with constant brightness: `--g-color-text-light-primary` and `--g-color-text-dark-primary`. If the brand color changes brightness, you can try `-g-color-text-primary` or `--g-color-text-inverted-primary`.

**--g-color-text-link**

Link color.

![Link color](/static/images/design/Branding/LinkColor.png)

**--g-color-text-link-hover**

Hover color for links.

![Hover link color](/static/images/design/Branding/HoverLinkColor.png)

**--g-color-text-link-visited**

Visited link color.

![Visited link color](/static/images/design/Branding/VisitedLinkColor.png)

**--g-color-text-link-visited-hover**

Hover color for visited links.

### 2. Typography

All text styles are listed in the Local Styles section in the right column of the library. This section is displayed when no objects are selected (otherwise, the attributes of the selected object are displayed, not the library):

![Typography](/static/images/design/Branding/Typography1.png)

To access the text style editing interface, click the settings icon to the right of the style name:

![Typography](/static/images/design/Branding/Typography2.png)

Styles are divided into 3 groups.

![Typography](/static/images/design/Branding/Typography3.png)

1.  **Header** — Contains headings, subheadings, and display styles.
2.  **Text** – Styles for body text and captions.
3.  **Misc** – Styles for pure code, as well as for code embedded within regular body text (inline styles).

For the Header and Text groups, you can choose one font but set different weights. Headings often use a heavier weight relative to the body font.

For the Misc group, you can set a monospaced font. Ensure that inline styles are displayed correctly when embedded in body text and that the baseline of the text doesn't shift. If this is not the case, you should adjust the Line Height parameter accordingly.

Slight adjustments to `Font Size` and `Line Height` parameters are permissible for styles. Different font families can have noticeably different character widths and heights, and in some cases, these changes need to be compensated for. It's important to remember that specific text styles are used with specific component sizes, and significant changes to style parameters might cause components to display incorrectly. Therefore, any changes to `Font Size` and `Line Height` should be followed by a check of component display across various sizes.

### 3. Corner Radii

This parameter is configured in the variable management interface. The values are located in the `Border Radius` collection. This attribute is defined by variables from two groups: primary and technical.

![Corner radius](/static/images/design/Branding/CornerRadius.png)

### Primary Set

This set of variables corresponds to the variables in the code. These values are applied to controls of corresponding sizes:

- `--g-border-radius-xs: 3px;`
- `--g-border-radius-s: 5px;`
- `--g-border-radius-m: 6px;`
- `--g-border-radius-l: 8px;`
- `--g-border-radius-xl: 10px;`
- `--g-border-radius-2xl: 16px.`

### Technical Set

This set is used exclusively in Figma to calculate the corner radii of the inner element within the `Check Button` component. These are variables with the `Inner` suffix, and their values should be linked to the values of the primary set variables. To calculate the value of an `Inner` variable, take the value of the primary variable of the same size and subtract 3.

For example, if `--g-border-radius-m: 6px`, then `Inner M radius` = 6 - 3 = 3px.

### 4. Technical Colors

This group includes scrollbar colors supported by the design system. They should be defined to prevent incorrect scrollbar display in dark themes across certain browsers.

Variables in this group:

- `--g-color-scroll-track;`
- `--g-color-scroll-handle;`
- `--g-color-scroll-handle-hover;`
- `--g-color-scroll-corner.`

# Additional Theme Settings

### Customizing Private Colors

If you need to change a specific color shade to align with brand colors, the private palette will be useful. Private colors are configured in the variable management interface, within the `Private Colors` collection.

![Private color tuning](/static/images/design/Branding/PrivateColorTuning.png)

Here's the translated design guide source file:

Base chromatic colors:

- Blue;
- Green;
- Red;
- Yellow;
- Orange;
- Cool Gray;
- Purple.

Any of these (or all at once) may need to be adapted to brand colors. To create a palette ready for handover to development, you can use the [script](https://preview.gravity-ui.com/uikit/?path=/docs/branding-palette-generator--docs), the results of which will then need to be transferred to Figma.

If the page background has been changed (or the background in the opposite theme), new solid shades for black and white should also be generated.

When the private palette is changed, semantic colors will update automatically.

### Semantic Color Customization

If the values of private variables do not match the expectations of the brand's visual language, you can change the semantic color values. These are configured in the variable editing interface within the Color Styles collection.

![Semantic color tuning](/static/images/design/Branding/SemanticColorTuning.png)

Keep the following in mind:

1. Private colors should be used for the corresponding theme.
2. Replacing private colors with an alpha channel with solid colors (and vice versa) can cause issues.
3. Changes to semantic variables will automatically apply to color styles and components where they are used.

# Synchronization with Development

Currently, theme synchronization between the Figma library and the code is done manually. For handover to development, you need to prepare CSS variables ([see instructions](https://preview.gravity-ui.com/uikit/?path=/docs/branding-overview--docs)).
