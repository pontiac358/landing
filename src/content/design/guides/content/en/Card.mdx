The `Card` component is used to divide content into logical blocks. Essentially, it's a container for grouping content with an optional ability to collapse the content.

## Usage

The component comes in 4 types.

![Usage](/static/images/design/Card/Placement.png)

## **Card with Theming (`With themes`)**

![Placement](/static/images/design/Card/Placement1.png)

A themed card can change its background color or border. It's often used for descriptions of errors/successes of a particular block or for user warnings. Most frequently, this card is used in the default color (normal) to group content. The `theme` parameter is used to specify the card's theme, and `view` controls the border or filled state.

For cards of this type (`type: container`), you can choose:

**View**: Outlined / Filled.

**Theme**: Normal, Info, Success, Warning, Danger (color).

![theme](/static/images/design/Card/theme.png)

- Normal — the default state of the card with an outline, used in most cases.
- Info — used in situations related to informing the user.
- Success — used to display positively colored events.
- Warning — used to display warning information.
- Danger — a container designed to draw maximum attention to events such as data loss, service disruptions, etc.

## **Selectable Card**

![Selectable](/static/images/design/Card/Selectable.png)

Cards in this group are intended for selecting one of the proposed options. The card has three states: normal, selected, and hover.

For this type (`type = selection`), you can choose:

**selected**: true / false

**disabled**: true / false

## **Raised Card**

Like the **Normal** variant from the `With themes` group, it serves to group content. The difference lies in the presence of a shadow. We recommend using it for areas where an additional emphasis on the card is needed – for example, for widgets:

![Raised](/static/images/design/Card/Raised.png)

It's important to note that for such cards, sufficient spacing should be provided between them so that the shadow doesn't extend onto the neighboring card.

When using the `L` size, the card has a more "airy" shadow, so when using this size, the spacing between cards should be slightly larger than for size `M`.

**type**: container

**view**: raised

## **`Raised with action` Card**

This is similar to the card above, but it implies an action when clicking on the card. Unlike the **Raised** view card, it has a hover state, but it does not have a "selected option" state like the `Selectable` card. We recommend using it when you need to give the user a choice with detailed descriptions inside the card.

It's important to note that clicking on it redirects to a nested page, so users should expect this behavior from the card (this should be clear from its appearance).

![WithActions](/static/images/design/Card/WithActions.png)

For this type (`type = action`), you can choose:

**disabled**: true / false

## Size

![Sizes M and L, using the example of cards with a shadow (Raised)](/static/images/design/Card/Size.png)

Sizes `M` and `L` using the example of cards with a shadow (`Raised`).

Two sizes are available: `M` and `L`. The size determines the radius of the corners: `L radius` (8 px) and `2XL radius` (16 px). The card size is chosen based on its placement, spacing, and the size of controls on the page. For example, if size `L` is used for inputs, buttons, and other elements on the page, it is recommended to use a corresponding card size.

The width and height of the component are chosen based on the content inside. The minimum size can be chosen with a small margin from the content. The maximum can be equal to 100% of the page width.

### Usage Examples

Card usage examples:

1 — `with themes` with a fill to inform the user;

2 — card with a border to group content.
