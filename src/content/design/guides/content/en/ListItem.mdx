**List** — a versatile list component that acts as a container for data rows, arranged in a single vertical column. This component sorts its `list-item` children internally, supporting various sizes, and allows for filtering and keyboard selection management.

**List Item (`List-item`)**

All list items support rendering in 4 sizes: `S`, `M`, `L`, and `XL`. The sizes and paddings align with the library elements the component interacts with, such as `select`, `input`, and `button`, which support similar sizing variables.

**List (`List`)**

By default, the `List` component's width is dynamic and calculated based on the width of the longest item in the list. Optionally, the width can be set to a fixed value or inherit the width of the element that triggered the list display (`select`, `input`).

**Customizable Height for the Overall List Container**

The height of list items or a function returning the height value can be set dynamically or specified with an exact pixel value. If the list items exceed the height, a scrollbar appears. The height can be set manually or changed dynamically.

**Filtering and Search**

An input field can be optionally enabled within the component for quick filtering of elements inside the list. The default filter placeholder can be changed depending on the component's task.

**Triggering Mechanisms**

By default, the `List` component is triggered by interaction with other elements on the page, such as `Select`, `Label`, `Button`, and is also used as a suggestion for the `Input` component.

**Virtualization**

With the virtualization flag enabled, the browser renders only a small subset of rows at any given time, significantly reducing the time required for re-rendering components. When using this method, commonly known as "infinite scrolling," new items are added to the list as the user scrolls to a specific threshold element (trigger).
