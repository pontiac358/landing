The component allows the user to select a parameter or action from a contextual list. A button with a three-dot icon is typically used to open the dropdown list. The icon can be reassigned to any other, and navigation between list items can be controlled with the keyboard.

**Icon**

By default, the context menu trigger icon has 4 built-in sizes:

`S` (24 x 24 px), `M` (28 x 28 px), `L` (36 x 36 px), and `XL` (44 x 44 px).

**Component Width**

In cases where a menu item is longer than the element that triggers it, the menu will expand to the width of the longest item in the list. The maximum component width is 280 px. If the menu item text exceeds this width, it will be truncated with an ellipsis.

The context menu trigger icon can be resized or replaced with any other icon. By default, the component uses a three-dot button with a 16 px icon size.

**Nested Dropdown Submenus**

Context menu items can be nested within each other. By default, nesting is supported up to 3 levels deep.

**Placement**

By default, the dropdown menu opens below the element that triggers it, with the menu icon located in the right corner. If the interface doesn't allow for rendering the dropdown list below the toggle icon, the list opens above the icon.

**Closing the Context Menu**

The context menu can be closed by clicking outside of it or by pressing the Esc key. The menu hides when the page is scrolled (optional, this behavior can be disabled).

# Recommendations

Dropdown menus are used when you have a choice of at least two options. The optimal number of options is between 5 and 10.

When organizing menu items, maintain a logical order, placing the most in-demand and popular options at the top. Test different menu items and refine them as needed.
