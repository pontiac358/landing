The module is the basic unit of measurement for space within the design system. The grid is built upon the spatial module, and component sizes and spacing are calculated and selected based on it. Using the module helps to unify the principles for defining spacing and sizes within the design system, as well as achieve visual consistency between Figma layouts and the final implementation in production.

# Module

In our design system, we use a 4x4 px module for forming and measuring space. All container and component spacing is calculated based on this spatial size. For exceptional cases, we use a 2x2 px micromodule.

# Spacing System

We use a limited set of tokenized spacing values to help create clean and consistent layouts. Use the pre-configured Figma tokens when creating interfaces and constructing components within the design system.

# Types of Spacing

**Padding and Margin**

Internal (padding) and external (margin) symmetrical or asymmetrical spacing from all 4 borders of a container to its content.

**Horizontal and Vertical Stacks**

In horizontal and vertical stacks, spacing defines the vertical and horizontal relationships between elements within a container.
