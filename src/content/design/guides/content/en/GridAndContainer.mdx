Here's the translated design guide source file:

The spacing module helps define strict rules for calculating sizes and indents, while the grid helps organize the content formed on their basis into structured blocks for perception. We use a 12, 8, and 4 column grid, as it allows us to divide the selected area into halves, thirds, and quarters.

# Grid Anatomy

![Grid structure](/static/images/design/GridAndContainer/structure.png)

Columns ➊ define boundaries for horizontal alignment, gutters ➋ provide spacing between grid columns, and margins ➌ provide spacing and center alignment for the container ➍. The width of the grid columns is determined using a percentage value, and the default gutter step is always a fixed value of 20 px.

# Container

![Container](/static/images/design/GridAndContainer/container.png)

A container is a fundamental structural element of the design system that holds and aligns content within a given viewport. We use two types of containers: `Fixed` with a constant width (meaning its fixed `max-width` can change at each breakpoint) and `Fluid` with a floating width, which will always occupy 100% of the available space (except for `S`, `XS`, and `2XS` sizes).

# Breakpoints

Media query control points, or breakpoints, are predefined viewport areas with a set width that allow for managing different grid settings.

# Exclusion Zones

![Exclusion zones](/static/images/design/GridAndContainer/zones.png)

In a UI layout, users expect to find certain types of content in specific areas. We call these areas exclusion zones, and the grid does not apply to them. When flexible or navigation panels expand, they either condense the content and grid or push the content outside the browser. Overlay panels appear on top of the content without affecting the main container.
