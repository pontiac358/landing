A label contains textual information about an object and describes its property, such as status or type. Labels are used for categorization, marking, or classification, as well as for annotating entities in a "key-value" format.

### Usage

Labels are used everywhere (e.g., in cards, tables, entity pages) to indicate object properties and help users quickly identify and classify content. Typically, labels are displayed next to the objects they refer to.

A specific use case is displaying the count of objects that don't fit when listed. In this scenario, hovering over the label reveals a popover with a list of the remaining entities.

Labels can also be used as tags to organize entities and make them easier to work with.

When displaying labels in a table, limit the number of labels per cell (a maximum of 2-3 labels in a row and a maximum of 2 columns with labels in one table), as well as the maximum number of characters (a maximum of 20 characters per label, followed by an ellipsis).

### Structure

![Application Examples](/static/images/design/Label/Application.png)

1.  **Left icon:** Optional, non-interactive. Used for quicker information retrieval.
2.  **Text:** It is recommended to use no more than 20 characters per label. You can use adjectives (e.g., "new," "active," "free"), participles ("stopped"), nouns ("discount"), and adverbs. The label text should not contain verbs (e.g., "enable"). If a verb is required, it's better to use a button.
3.  **Key-value text:** An alternative text format used for manual object annotation by the user. For example, you can assign tags like `service: delivery`, `release: 23` to an object.

4 — right icon, interactive. It could be a close or copy icon, for example.

### Sizes

**There are 3 label sizes:**

**XS** — used in most places: tables, lists, headers, popups, entity pages.

**S** — used in forms for previewing added labels and where space allows.

**M** — a similar size is used less often because it resembles a button.

### Themes

**Without semantic coloring**:

**Default** — the default label, often used to highlight information, without semantic coloring.

**Clear** — has no background, only an outline. Used for minimal emphasis.

**With semantic coloring**:

**Unknown** — a neutral option, used when there's no need to draw attention to the information wrapped in the label.

**Accent** — for highlighting important information and for "in progress" operations.

**Success** — for displaying a successfully completed process or the "health" of an entity.

**Warning** — for exceptional situations, to warn the user about something.

**Danger** — to attract maximum attention when an error has occurred and actions need to be taken to resolve the issue.

### Semantic Labels vs. Buttons

Labels, including those with semantic coloring, are used to indicate status. The only available interactions with them are hovering over the label or clicking the icon. A label cannot be in a `Selected` state. If you need to create an interactive element based on semantic labels (e.g., for status filters), it's better to use buttons: they have a pressed (applied) `Selected` state and support semantic colors.

### Modifications and States

All labels have 5 available states: text only, icon before text, icon after text, icons before and after, and icon only.

You can interact with:

Here's the translated design guide source file:

1.  **With the entire label** — for example, hovering over the label displays a tooltip with detailed information.

2.  **Separately with a right-side icon** — depending on the icon, clicking it can delete the label or copy its value.

The main rule when adding interaction to a label is to ensure that the possibility of interacting with the label is clear to the user.

### Additional Features

Based on labels, dynamic filters can be built to sort content. Clicking the plus icon adds a new value, and clicking the cross cancels the filter.

If your interface allows users to create their own tags and mark objects, users should be able to add and remove labels.

### Customization

The label's colors, rounding, size, and spacing can be changed. The text within the label should be easily readable.

When the user hovers their mouse over a label, change its appearance or color to indicate interactivity.
