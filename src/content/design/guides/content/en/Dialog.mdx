**Dialog** is used to display secondary content and to focus the user's attention on performing a specific action or scenario. A dialog blocks user interaction with the parent page until it is closed or the target action within it is completed.

### Entry Point

The entry point to a dialog can be a click on a specific trigger (e.g., a button in the interface) or certain actions or conditions that arise in the interface (e.g., attempting to leave the page without saving data, or changing accounts in another tab).

### Sizes

The size of the dialog is chosen based on its content.

![Sizes](/static/images/design/Dialog/sizes.png)

**Size S (480 px)** is used for small warnings or confirmations, as well as small forms.

**Size M (720 px)** is used for small and medium-sized forms.

**Size L (900 px)** is used for large amounts of data and complex flows within the modal window.

**Custom size** is used when none of the three options (`S`, `M`, or `L`) are suitable.

### Content Area

The content within a dialog can be arbitrary. The layout is chosen based on needs.

If the dialog contains a form, it is recommended to use one of two types of element arrangement:

<div className="row">
   <div className="col-12 col-md-6">
      **Vertical Type**

      More suitable for simple text-based dialogs and for size `S`.

   </div>
   <div className="col-12 col-md-6">
      **Horizontal Type**

      Suitable for more complex forms.

   </div>
</div>

### Buttons

An action button is almost always needed. If the user has not completed the required actions in the dialog, the button remains in the `Disabled` state.
The left side provides an area for arbitrary controls. Here you can place auxiliary buttons or links, such as help information.

Sometimes, a `danger` button can be used instead of an `action` button (for example, in a deletion confirmation dialog).

An `action` button is not needed if there's no primary action and the dialog is purely informational. In such cases, use a "Close" button with the `Normal` style.

A `secondary` button is always used as a cancel button. It can also be used for secondary actions (e.g., "Continue without changes").

![Group 2087326024.png](/static/images/design/Dialog/Group_2087326024.png)

Buttons might not be present at all. This is typically the case when a choice needs to be made within the content area itself, and without it, the parent interface would be inaccessible.

### Navigation within the Dialog

If the dialog involves a multi-step process, use a "Back" button for navigation.

If the dialog has nested content but not in a linear step-by-step fashion, breadcrumbs can be used within the content area.

### Dialog Positioning on the Page

The dialog is centered both vertically and horizontally on the screen.

When the viewport scales, the positioning is maintained, and the dialog size decreases, provided it doesn't obstruct the content within.

The minimum allowed padding from the top and left edges of the screen is 20 px.

![position](/static/images/design/Dialog/position.png)

If the dialog doesn't fit within the viewport, the top and left paddings will remain fixed, and the dialog will extend beyond the screen edges on the right and bottom. This is an undesirable state. It's recommended to design dialogs so they fit within the viewport on any screen, with at least 20 px padding from all edges.

### Closing the Dialog

In addition to performing the primary action, the modal dialog can be closed in the following ways:

<div className="row">
   <div className="col-12 col-md-6">
      1. By clicking the "Cancel" button:

```md
   ![cancel_btn](/static/images/design/Dialog/cancel_btn.png)
   </div>
   <div className="col-12 col-md-6">
      2. Via the close icon:

      ![x_btn](/static/images/design/Dialog/x_btn.png)
   </div>
</div>

If the dialog is non-blocking, it can be closed in the following ways:

- By clicking outside the modal window.
- By pressing the Esc key.

The "Cancel" button and the close icon are familiar elements, as they are universally used in dialog windows for closing. Clicking outside the modal window helps the user close it more easily and quickly, as they don't need to aim for the first two elements. Pressing the Esc key allows closing the window without using the mouse.

Since interaction is intended only with the dialog window, the content of the parent page should not scroll.

### Protection Against User Data Loss

Due to the ease of closing a modal window, there's a risk of doing so accidentally. If the user was only selecting checkboxes in the modal window, losing such data is easier to recover from than when the user has been typing code for a long time or re-entering a 12-digit car VIN. We must prevent such situations. At the same time, we should not prevent the user from closing the modal window in their usual way.

To avoid data loss errors, it's best to use an **additional confirmation window for data deletion**. In this case, the user will need to confirm the action.

Whether to add another confirmation window when closing a modal window should be assessed based on common sense. It's important to strike a balance between security and potential annoyance from too frequent prompts. The goal of confirmation is to prevent the loss of user-entered data without hindering their workflow.
