The component allows users to browse content page by page, for example, in tables.

## Usage

✅ **When to use**

- For all cases with paginated output.
- If it might be necessary to "jump" over several pages or go directly to the desired one.
- In cases where it's useful to customize the number of rows displayed.
- To fix the size of blocks within a page, so that the automatic loading of content at the top doesn't constantly shift the content at the bottom.

🚫 **When not to use**

In cases where it's important to ensure a seamless transition between pages of results, we recommend using automatic loading or loading via a button, provided it doesn't slow down the page's performance.

<div className="row">
   <div className="col-12 col-md-6">

   </div>
   <div className="col-12 col-md-6">

   </div>
</div>

## Structure

![IMG - 18.png](/static/images/design/Pagination/paginator-0005.png)

1. **Current page** — displays the sequential number of the page being shown.
2. **Previous page** — opens the previous page.
3. **Next page** — opens the next page.
4. **Last content page** — shown if the total content count is known and can be immediately divided into pages. Clicking it opens the last page.
5. **Overflow icon** — appears if there are more than 4 pages.
6. **Forward/backward navigators** — switch pages sequentially.
7. **Go to first page** — opens the first page of content.
8. **Go to specific page** — by entering the page number and pressing Enter, opens the specified page.
9. **Number of items per page** — a switcher for the number of items displayed on one page.

It's not necessary to use all structural elements together. Available configurations are listed in the "Modifications" section.

## Sizes

By default, the size of buttons, input fields, and select elements in the paginator is `M`.

## States

![IMG - 19.png](/static/images/design/Pagination/paginator-0007.png)

**First page** — displays the first page.

**Second/next page** — state for displaying the second and subsequent pages.

**Last page** — displays the last page.

## Variations

1. **Page Size Options and Show Input** — if it's not possible to navigate to a specific page or control the amount of content displayed per page, these fields can be disabled.
2. **Total Unknown** — a variation displaying only the current page. Used when the total number of items is unknown.
3. **Hide Pages** — page selectors without sequential numbers. Used when the list of items is dynamic, and the page count and sequential numbers will constantly change, potentially confusing the user.
4. **Compact** — a compact version without text. Used when the interface area is limited (e.g., a dialog box).

For mobile device interfaces, you can use the mobile version of the paginator.
