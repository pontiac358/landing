Here's the translated design guide source file:

A clickable element with a navigation function. When clicked, it opens another page of an external service or within the service. Less commonly, it moves the user to another part of the page.

They can be of three types: `normal` (accented), `primary` (black), `secondary` (gray).

**`normal` type**

The most familiar and established usage pattern for users. It's used for visual separation of an element within text, tables, and as part of navigation. It's also used on error pages and zero states.

**`primary` type**

Used when it's intuitively clear to the user that the element is interactive, but visually using accent-colored links would overload the interface and disrupt the balance of elements on the page.

**`secondary` type**

Like `primary` links, these are used when it's clear to the user that the element is interactive, and the goal is not to compete with the accents on the page. They are more often used in breadcrumbs or when displaying secondary attributes.

## **States**

Links always have a default and hover state.

If necessary, a marker can be enabled for visited links.

## **Can be used as:**

- standalone elements;
- part of a continuous text.

They can have an icon as an indicator of a transition to an external resource.

## Size

The font size for links should match the overall hierarchy on the page and be proportional to the surrounding text.

## Recommendations

The link text should be understandable to the user even when taken out of context and should contain information about where the link redirects (service name, section title, or description).
