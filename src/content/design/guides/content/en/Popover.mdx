Here's the translated design guide source file:

Popover is a tooltip that appears on hover, click, or keyboard focus on an element.

It's used to provide context or additional details without navigating away from the current screen. Popover enhances the user experience by offering quick access to needed information without cluttering the main interface.

## Types of Popover

### Informational (Info)

For use in everyday interfaces.

## Parameters

The parameters described below can be configured for all types of Popovers (informational, special, and announcement):

-   sizes;
-   content type;
-   positioning;
-   "Close" button;
-   opening and closing methods;
-   timing.

### **Sizes**

The component's sizes differ in font size and padding from the edges. The width and height of the component adapt to the content.

<div className="row">
   <div className="col-12 col-md-6">
      **S** – font size 13 px, side padding 16 px:

   </div>
   <div className="col-12 col-md-6">
      **L** – font size 15 px, side padding 24 px:

   </div>
</div>

### Content Type

The component supports the following elements:

1.  Title.
2.  Description.
3.  Action buttons (you can use one or two buttons, and also swap their positions).
4.  Close icon.
5.  Pin (tail) – an additional indicator for attachment to an interface element. It helps in cases where there are many elements nearby and you need to focus the user's attention on a specific one.

### Positioning

Popover can appear on different sides of an element depending on its placement in the interface. If a pin is used, it will point towards the center of the interface element.

### "Close" Button

A close button is needed if the Popover is triggered by a click, not by hovering or focusing on an interface element, as a way to dismiss the tooltip.

### Trigger and Dismissal Methods

- **On hover**
  The component disappears when the cursor moves away.
- **On click**
  To close the component, click the close icon (X).
- **On keyboard focus**
  The Popover disappears when the element loses focus.
- **Automatically without user interaction**
  The Popover will be open when the user lands on the page. Suitable for promotional and tutorial tooltips. Click the close icon (X) to dismiss.
- **In response to interface actions**
  For example, during onboarding, when a series of tooltips is planned.

### Timing

- **No delay in appearance and disappearance**
  The Popover will open and close instantly. Suitable for simple, everyday tooltips.
- **With delay in appearance and disappearance**
  A delay in appearance is useful if the page has many elements that trigger tooltips. It helps prevent accidental hovers and unwanted tooltip appearances. A delay in disappearance is necessary if the tooltip contains buttons, allowing the user time to move their cursor to the button before the tooltip closes.
- **With delay in disappearance**
  If the Popover contains buttons but there's no need to delay its appearance, use this option.

## Special Cases

In most cases, a Popover is suitable for providing additional information. However, there are scenarios where other components should be preferred.

Here's the translation of your design guide source file into English, aiming for natural phrasing for developers and keeping all technical terms and MDX components intact:

- If you have a complex tooltip and the elements supported within the `Popover` component are insufficient for your needs, you can design your tooltip based on the `Popup` component: [Popup](/design/guides/popup).
- If you need to provide the user with an explanation or additional information about an action that will occur after clicking a button, use the [Action Tooltip](/design/guides/action-tooltip) or [Tooltip](/design/guides/tooltip) for this purpose, rather than `Popover`.
