A checkbox is an interface element that allows users to select one or more options from a given list.

## Usage Examples

![Cases](/static/images/design/Checkbox/Checkbox1.png)

After activating a checkbox, the action doesn't trigger instantly. To apply changes, the user needs to click a confirmation button (e.g., "Save," "Apply," "Submit"). In most cases, a checkbox is used with a label explaining its purpose. However, there are scenarios where a checkbox can be used without a label, such as in tables or when displaying a label like "Enable" next to every checkbox might be redundant. Text should start with a positive phrasing, for example, "Enable" instead of "Disable," otherwise, the user has to solve a logical puzzle.

## Anatomy

A checkbox consists of:

1.  **Container** — a visual rectangular area that surrounds the checkbox. The container serves to define the boundary and activate the checkbox.
2.  **Checkmark** — a symbol that appears inside the container when the checkbox is activated. This symbol serves as a visual confirmation of the user's selection.
3.  **Text Label (optional)** — text positioned to the right of the checkbox. The text label explains the meaning or purpose of the checkbox.

## Sizes

The `Checkbox` component has two main sizes:

**M** — used by default and has standard dimensions suitable for most cases. In this size, the container is 14x14 px, and the text label uses a 13 px font.

**L** — used when a checkbox needs to stand out among other interface elements or when larger elements are required for better usability. In this size, the container is 17x17 px, and the text label uses a 15 px font.

## States

Here's the translated design guide source file:

**Default** — the primary state of a checkbox, which can be toggled on or off by clicking.

**Hover** — the state when the cursor hovers over the checkbox area (checkbox + label).

**Disable** — the state when interaction with the checkbox is unavailable for any reason.

**Indeterminate** — the state of a checkbox group header when one of several items is selected (often found in tables with multiple row selections).

## Recommendations

### When to Use

- **Option Selection** — when the user needs to select one or more options from a presented list.

- **Enabling/Disabling Features** — when the user can turn specific features in the interface on or off. For example, you can enable or disable notifications, auto-play, and other features. In such cases, checkboxes provide intuitive interaction.

- **Multiple Selection in Tables or Lists** — when the user needs to select multiple items for group operations, such as deletion or export. This simplifies data management and makes performing group actions more convenient.

- **Content or Result Filtering** — in filters, where the user selects parameters to filter content or search results.

### When Not to Use

- **Selecting Only One Option** — if the user must choose only one option from a set of mutually exclusive choices, it's better to use radio buttons.

- **Two-State On/Off (Instant Action)** — if an option has only two states (on and off) and changes should take effect immediately without pressing an "Apply" button, it's better to use switches for this purpose. They provide a clearer and more concise representation for such options and allow changes to be applied instantly.

Here's the translated design guide source file:

- **Segmented Control** — If there are multiple mutually exclusive options that can be selected simultaneously across different categories, use segment controls. They allow the user to select options within different segments or categories.

- **Selecting from a Large Number of Options** — If there's a long list of options to choose from, it's better to use a select (dropdown) component. This will save screen space and make it easier to choose from a large set of options.

### Writing Text

- Aim for brevity in text descriptions. Avoid long phrases or complex sentences.
- Use active verbs that clearly indicate the action associated with the selection (e.g., "Subscribe to newsletter" instead of "Newsletter subscription").
- Give users a complete understanding of what will happen if they select a checkbox (e.g., "Receive notifications about new articles" instead of "Notifications").
