Here's the translated design guide source file:

Button – an interactive user interface element that performs an action when clicked, such as submitting a form, saving changes, or proceeding to the next step. If you need to navigate to another page or website, we recommend using a link.

## Appearance

There are 5 types of buttons: Accent, Primary, Semantic, Raised, and Contrast.

### **Accent**

![Accent](/static/images/design/Button/Button1.png)

Accent buttons are designed to highlight key actions and draw users' attention to important operations. They are presented in three main styles: Action, Outlined Action, and Flat Action.

The choice between these types of accent buttons depends on the desired degree of emphasis on actions within the interface. Action is suitable for the highest priority, Outlined Action for medium priority, and Flat Action for lower priority or secondary operations.

It is recommended to use accent buttons cautiously in the interface and, if possible, limit their number to one per page (excluding dialog windows). This helps emphasize importance and highlight the main action for the user, reducing the risk of interface overload with too many accent elements.

### **Primary**

![Primary](/static/images/design/Button/Button2.png)

Primary buttons are intended for performing main and general actions within the interface. These buttons are available in several styles: Normal, Outlined, Flat, and Flat Secondary. The choice between these styles depends on the degree of emphasis on specific actions in the interface. For example, a Normal button is suitable for ordinary actions, Outlined for medium-priority actions, and Flat and Flat Secondary are designed for less important or secondary operations.

### Semantic

Semantic buttons are buttons that carry semantic meaning and convey a specific context or action. They are used so that users can easily understand what operations are being performed and what their meaning is.

Semantic buttons are presented in four main styles: Info, Success, Warning, and Danger.

### Info

Here's the translated design guide source file:

![Info](/static/images/design/Button/Button3.png)

Used for actions related to obtaining additional information, hints, or context. Info buttons can also serve as hyperlinks when it's necessary to highlight the ability to navigate to another resource (e.g., "Learn More," "Documentation," "Help").

**Success**

![Success](/static/images/design/Button/Button4.png)

Used in the interface to highlight actions that have been completed successfully.

**Warning**

![Warning](/static/images/design/Button/Button5.png)

Used to emphasize actions that require user attention due to potential risks or warnings. These buttons help the user understand the possible consequences of an action and be more cautious.

**Danger**

![Danger](/static/images/design/Button/Button6.png)

Used to highlight actions that can be destructive or have negative consequences if performed. We recommend using this button with caution and only where it's truly necessary to emphasize potentially negative aspects (e.g., deletion, stopping, disabling).

**Raised**

![Raised](/static/images/design/Button/Button7.png)

Raised buttons are a type of button that appears elevated above the content. They are used to highlight important actions on the screen, usually with a fixed position. This button type is suitable for key operations that the user should notice immediately.

These buttons are also often used in card interfaces and graphical applications to perform various actions, such as zooming, panning, or other manipulations of graphical data.

**Contrast Buttons**

![Contrast](/static/images/design/Button/Button8.png)

**Contrast Buttons** are a special type of button used to highlight actions on complex backgrounds. Such buttons create bright and clear contrast, ensuring excellent visibility even on diverse and rich backgrounds, such as banners and marketing materials.

These buttons help highlight actions and ensure good visibility on various backgrounds, such as banners.

## Anatomy

The anatomy of a button in the interface includes various styling options:

![Anatomy](/static/images/design/Button/Button9.png)

Here's the translated design guide source file:

1.  **Text Only** — A button that contains only text. This type of button is useful when the text itself clearly and unambiguously conveys the button's purpose, especially when the text is short and informative. For example, such a button can be used for "create" or "cancel" actions.
2.  **Icon on the Right** — A button where the icon is located to the right of the text. This option is useful when you need to present different ways to perform the same action. For example, such a button can be used for a "save" action, where the user has several options to choose from ("save as PDF/RTF/HTML...").
3.  **Icon on the Left** — A button where the icon is located to the left of the text. This option is useful when the icon carries key information and needs to be highlighted. For example, such a button can be used for "run" or "delete" actions.
4.  **Icons on the Right and Left** — A button with icons placed both to the left and right of the text. This option is useful when you need to emphasize a key action with an icon and provide different paths for its execution. For example, such a button can be used for an "add" action, where the user has several options to choose from ("add project/resource/document...").
5.  **Icon Only** — A button that consists only of an icon and does not contain text. This option is useful when the information on the button is easily understood visually and does not require additional text explanations. It is also used when you need to compactly group many actions in a limited area and there is no possibility to place buttons with text labels. For example, a delete button in a list of items might look like an icon with a trash can image without a text label.

## States

Each button in the interface has five main states that help visually indicate the button's availability and current action to the user.

![States](/static/images/design/Button/Button10.png)

Here's the translated design guide source file:

**Default** — the primary state of a button, where it's ready for interaction and awaiting user actions.

**Hover** — the state where the button is ready for interaction and awaiting user actions.

**Disable** — a state where the button is temporarily unavailable for interaction. To improve user understanding, it's recommended to explain the reason for disabling, especially if it's not obvious. This explanation can be presented as text next to the button or as a tooltip on mouse hover.

**Loading** — a state that indicates the system is in the process of performing an operation in response to a user-initiated action.

**Selected** — this state is used for toggleable elements where the user can choose one of several options. A button in the `Selected` state indicates the currently chosen state or option.

## Sizes

Each button can be used in four sizes, allowing you to choose the most suitable option depending on the context of use.

![Sizes](/static/images/design/Button/Button11.png)

**XS** — an extra-small size used for actions within components with limited space.

**S** — applied in situations where regular buttons are too large and take up too much space, such as in tables or small cards.

**M** — the primary size, recommended for default use.

**L** — used to highlight primary actions in creation forms, modal windows, or pop-ups.

**XL** — used in places where actions need to be emphasized and there is enough space to accommodate them (e.g., on a website or landing page).

## Shape

The `pin` property provides the ability to control the shape of buttons, defining their style with the following values:

![Form](/static/images/design/Button/Button12.png)

**round** — a button with a rounded shape (rounded corners on both sides). This style gives the button a soft and modern look, making it friendly and pleasant to interact with.

Here's the translated design guide source file:

**brick** – a button with sharp corners on both sides.

**clear** – the button has sharp corners and no border on both sides.

**circle** – the button is circular on both sides.

You can also combine these properties in different variations, allowing for the creation of unique button styles depending on the design concept and interface requirements.

## Width

The default button width automatically adjusts to the text, allowing the button to stretch horizontally to accommodate all text without truncation. However, if you need to control the button's width, you can use two main properties: `auto` and `max`:

![Width](/static/images/design/Button/Button13.png)

`auto` – limits the button's dimensions so that it does not exceed the container's boundaries. If the button's content does not fit within the container, it will be hidden with an ellipsis, indicating the presence of additional text.

`max` – sets a fixed button width equal to the width of the parent container. If the button's content exceeds this width, it will also be hidden with an ellipsis, which helps maintain a compact interface appearance and prevents container overflow.

## Recommendations

**Usage**

- Phrase button text clearly and concisely so users immediately understand what will happen after clicking.
- When using icons, ensure they clearly convey their meaning and are easily recognizable by your users.
- Maintain a balance between icons and text so that both elements are visible and readable, and neither dominates.
- When using icon-only buttons, we recommend adding `action tooltips` on hover so users can understand the icon's meaning.

**Writing Text**

Here's the translated design guide source file:

- Button text should clearly and concisely convey the essence of the action that will occur after clicking. Avoid long phrases or unclear abbreviations.
- Use verbs that describe the actions performed by the user, such as "save," "send," "delete."
- Avoid using words or phrases with negation on buttons. Negative instructions can cause confusion.
- Maintain a consistent style and format for text on all interface buttons. This helps users easily navigate and understand available actions.
