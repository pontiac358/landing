## Two-Layer Color System

The library is based on 2 palettes — private and semantic. They differ in structure and purpose. The private palette defines RGBA values for all tones and shades of all colors across all themes, while the semantic palette uses private colors as values and is applied to specific UI elements.

### **Private Colors**

This is the base layer of colors in the design system. They are not intended for direct use within components and serve as values for semantic variables, which are already used in components. The values of private variables are RGBA/RGB colors.

In this palette, for each theme, all tones of all colors are listed, with and without an alpha channel, with the **Solid** suffix.

### **Colors with Alpha Channel**

Colors with an alpha channel exist only for indices 500 and below. They are blended with the background color, which helps maintain readability and contrast. It is recommended to use them:

1) for light shades (from 50 to 300);
2) for projects related to typography, where text may be displayed over backgrounds of any color (using an alpha channel helps avoid unpleasant situations with loss of contrast).

### **Solid Colors**

Solid colors are needed where one object might overlap another and color blending at the overlap is not allowed. They are constructed considering the main background for the theme. Given that solid colors can also be displayed over arbitrary colored backgrounds, they should be used with caution.

When changing the main or contrasting background color, it is recommended to regenerate the shades to synchronize the appearance of solid colors and colors with an alpha channel.

### How to Build Tones
```

Tones are built from the middle of the scale, in our case, the color with index 550. This is the base color from which less saturated and more saturated tones are generated. Exceptions are black and white, which are at the edge of the scale and allow for the creation of more tones and values with an alpha channel.

Colors with indices from 50 to 500 are built by reducing the Opacity of the base color (550). Colors with an alpha channel exist only in this range, unlike solid colors, which can have values across the entire scale.

Colors with indices from 600 to 1000 are built by mixing in the background, which is contrasting to the base color for the selected theme. For example, in a light theme, the base background is white, and the contrasting background is the dark theme's background. This is added to the color to create darker tones.

In a dark theme, everything is reversed: the base background is dark, and the contrasting background is the light theme's background, i.e., in our case, white. This is added to the color to form tones with a high index.

There is a script that allows you to build a color scale directly in a format ready for development.

### **Semantic Colors**

Variables in this color group are divided into **groups** by categories, which are used in components by **meaning**. Their values are set for each theme using private variables. Sometimes, one semantic variable can serve as the value for another, but this requires caution to avoid recursion.

### **Categories by Type**

In Figma, for easier navigation, variables are divided into the groups listed below. However, the structure in code is more straightforward. Branding is not выделен into a separate category, and the Base group of variables is also a single one. By names, composition, and values, Figma and code are equivalent, except for cases where the name is optimized for better readability or understanding.

1. **Branding**

Here's the translated design guide source file:

A collection of brand variables gathered from all categories. These are base colors that allow for quick styling and previewing of results. This group is highlighted only in Figma. This group does not exist in the code; colors are distributed among their respective groups.

2. **Text**

   A group of variables for text and icon colors. Since text and icons are often displayed together, it's important to maintain their visual consistency.

3. **Base**

   A group of colors for various backgrounds, fills, and surfaces.

4. **Base Semantic**

   Colors for backgrounds with Info, Positive, Warning, Danger, and Misc tints. Values are provided for both Normal and Hover states. These may be suitable for some types of infographics, but not all. This group is highlighted only in Figma. In code, this is part of the **Base** group.

5. **Base Float**

   Colors for backgrounds of elements that float above the main page background. This group is highlighted only in Figma. In code, this is part of the **Base** group.

6. **Line**

   Colors for borders, lines, dividers, frames, and any other thin elements.

7. **Effects**

   Colors for text dimming, creating shadows, etc.

8. **Misc**

   A group with various technical colors – scrollbars, axes for charts, tooltip backgrounds in charts.

You can read more about the purpose of each variable in the color styles description in Figma or in the storybook.

### Categories by Meaning

Variables within each group may have their own specific meanings, dictated by the principles of how each group is applied. For example, for text, it makes sense to use categories like **primary** and **secondary**, which are not applicable to other content types.

Among the values common to different categories, the following are worth highlighting:

*   success
*   dangerous
*   warning
*   neutral
*   etc.

## Variables and Color Styles

Working with color values happens in the Local Variables interface in Figma. To access it, open the library file, ensure nothing is selected on the page (you can do this by clicking on the empty canvas background), and click on Local Variables in the right-hand panel.

Here's the translated design guide source file:

While variables are not yet out of beta, the design system continues to use color styles for directly defining an object's color. In this setup, the value within a color style is a corresponding variable. This means:

1. To change a color style's color, you need to change the color of the corresponding variable.
2. Color styles inherit the properties of variables, particularly support for color themes. Thus, an object with an applied color style can change its theme using only Figma's functionality.

## Themes

The Gravity-UI library supports 4 themes: light, dark, and their high-contrast versions. Currently, the industry standard is to support at least two: light and dark. It's difficult to choose one ideal theme, considering how diverse user preferences can be.

High-contrast themes were created as a solution for those who find the contrast in regular themes insufficient. This can be due to hardware specifics, such as monitor calibration, brightness settings, panel type, and color reproduction (especially with TVs), as well as room lighting. These themes cannot currently be considered a solution for ensuring accessibility.
