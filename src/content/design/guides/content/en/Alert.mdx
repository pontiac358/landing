Using `Alert` allows you to grab the user's attention and inform them of important information without interrupting their workflow.

![Example](/static/images/design/Alert/Example.png)

## When to Use

Primarily, `Alert` is designed to inform about system status, report errors and warnings, and guide the user towards their swift resolution through instructions, links, or commands.

## Types

Depending on the situation, different types of `Alert`s are shown to the user:

- `Danger` is used to inform the user that it's currently impossible to continue working according to the main scenario (e.g., no access to an object) or that further user actions might lead to irreversible loss of data or resources.
- `Warning` is used to inform the user that further work might be difficult or a secondary scenario might be unavailable.
- `Success` is used to inform the user about a status or a change in the system that has a positive connotation (e.g., successful completion of a long operation).
- `Info` is used to provide recommendations on how to work with the system that should be explicitly shown, or to announce any additional features for the user within the system.
- `Normal` is mainly used to highlight a piece of text, such as a short reference, a code example, calculation results, etc.

You should not substitute types solely for the desire to attract more user attention – for example, displaying important reference information in an `Alert` of type `Warning` or `Error`.

In addition to instructions, `Alert` can immediately offer a set of commands to reduce the user's effort in finding a solution and taking action.

## When Not to Use

`Alert` should be used sparingly because they attract attention and can distract from completing the main scenario, especially if the wrong `Alert` type is chosen.

Here's the translated design guide source file:

- It is not recommended to use `Alert` to display an error, warning, or help related to a specific field in a form or dialog. In such cases, it's better to use the `Error` state of the field component or display the message as plain text or text with an icon next to the field.
- It is not recommended to place multiple `Alert`s of type `Danger` and `Warning` on the same page (form, dialog), as this makes it difficult to prioritize messages.
- `Alert` should not be used for purposes other than its intended use, such as visually highlighting certain blocks on the page: headings, form fields, etc.
- `Alert` should not be used to confirm the completion of operations. Use `Dialog` for this purpose.
- `Alert` should not be used to display the status of an operation initiated by the user. Use `Toaster` for this purpose.

## Contents

The `Alert` component requires a description and an icon. In addition, an `Alert` can optionally contain a title (`Title`), a close button (`Close`), and up to three additional action buttons (`Actions`).

### Icon

By default, the `Alert` displays an icon corresponding to its type. However, you can define your own icon within the component while keeping the background color unchanged. For `Alert` of type `Normal`, the icon is optional and not shown by default.

### Text

The text for the title and description should start with a capital letter and be as concise as possible. For additional information, it's better to direct the user to a separate help page or website using links or buttons like "Help," "Information," "Learn More," etc.

The title should formulate a brief thesis of the message. The title text should not duplicate the description. If you cannot identify a main thesis and turn it into a title, it's better to have only the description without a title.

The title should not end with a period.

### Buttons

Depending on design requirements and constraints, additional buttons can be displayed to the right of the text (`Horizontal Layout`) or below it (`Vertical Layout`).

Here's the translated design guide source file:

The option with buttons aligned to the right can be chosen if the number of buttons and their names allow for enough space for the description and title without unnecessary line breaks. As a rule, if the Alert width is less than 500–600 px, it's better to choose the vertical layout.

Additional buttons use the `Normal` style by default, but depending on the message's semantics, they can be `Action`, `Contrast-normal`, and `Outline` of various types (`Outline-info`, `Outline-danger`, etc.). You shouldn't use three buttons with different styles. There can only be one `Action` button, and you need to consider the page context: are there already other `Action` buttons on it?

The `Alert` includes a "close" button, which should be displayed when the user might want to hide the message because they consider it no longer relevant.

## Variants

The width of the `Alert` is not limited; it can occupy all available space on the page (form, dialog) or have a fixed width corresponding to the main content's width.

If, according to the design, the `Alert` should be displayed flush with the page borders (form, dialog) and occupy the full width (e.g., a message about a browser update or cookie storage terms on a website), the `Alert` container may not have rounded corners.

![Options](/static/images/design/Alert/Options1.png)

If the design does not require actively drawing the user's attention to the `Alert`, it is recommended to use the outlined variant (`Outlined View`), which has the same semantic meaning as the filled variant (`Filled View`).
