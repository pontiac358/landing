**Breadcrumbs** — a chain of links reflecting the path in the service structure from the root page to the current one, with the ability to navigate to any page. This component helps the user understand where they are in the service and quickly navigate back one or more levels.

## Usage

- The Breadcrumbs component should be used if the service has nested pages.
- Breadcrumbs are not needed on the main page.
- Breadcrumbs are usually placed at the very top of the page in the action bar.

## Structure

1 — **Current page.**

2 — **Previous page**. It is recommended to display this first if the container width allows.

3 — **Service root page**.

4 — **Separator**. By default, `/` is used, but `>` can also be used.

5 — **Overflow icon**. Appears if all page names do not fit within the container width. Pages that don't fit are displayed in a dropdown menu that appears when you click on the ellipsis.

## Sizes

The base font size in breadcrumbs is `body-1`. Icon size is 16x16 px.

## States

**Default** — the default state.

**Hover** — the state when hovering over a page name.

**Disable** — a non-clickable option. Can be used for the current page or for pages that are not linked.

**Loading** — the component has the ability to pass a function to display the element's content via the `renderItemContent` parameter (for example, to display a `Skeleton` if the data for the breadcrumb item has not yet loaded).

## Modifications

The following additional elements can be placed in breadcrumbs:

Here's the translated design guide source file:

1.  **Action Icon** — for example, "add to favorites," "copy page title," context menu.
2.  **[Label](/design/guides/label)** — status or another property related to the page.
3.  **Select** — clicking on an element allows you to choose options.
4.  **Additional Text** — ID, count, other page properties.

You can also use a "home" icon to navigate to the main page as a replacement for the word "Home."

## Customization

You can change colors, separators, and hover styles. It's important to maintain a more prominent highlight for the current page and sufficient contrast for the elements.
