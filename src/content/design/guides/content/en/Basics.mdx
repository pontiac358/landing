Gravity-UI provides a set of libraries and components for building functional interfaces. The design system supports multiple themes: there's a **light** theme, a **dark** theme, and their **high-contrast** versions. The appearance of components can be flexibly customized for each of these themes.

**Color**

The design system includes 4 themes based on a two-layer color model. The theming mechanism is designed for flexible color customization and to support brand identities with varying requirements.

**Typography**

The typography system consists of styles for body text, display text, and code (monospaced font). You can use the default fonts or define your own.

**Control Border Radii**

A small but noticeable part of the visual style is the border radii of corners. For this, a set of variables for radii has been created. These variables are used in various controls. To adjust the radius in controls, simply change the variable values.

**Creating and Working with Themes**

Regardless of the brand and its visual language, everything boils down to a set of constants that need to be editable and used as a unified set in code and in the Figma library.
