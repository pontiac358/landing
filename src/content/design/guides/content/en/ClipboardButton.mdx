The clipboard copy button is a modification of the `Button` component of type `Flat` with a `ClipboardIcon` icon, placed separately.

### Icon

Inside `ClipboardButton` is the `ClipboardIcon` component — an icon with animation and two states: `Success` and `Error`. If the copy button needs to be styled, the standard `Button` component with the `ClipboardIcon` icon is used.

### States

### Sizes

The component supports standard button sizes: `XS`, `S`, `M`, `L`, and `XL`.

### Behavior

If copying content is an infrequent action and the icon degrades readability, the copy button is hidden and becomes visible only when the cursor approaches.

In tables, the icon is hidden and appears when the cursor is over a cell with content.

### Tooltip

The component has a disable-able tooltip. It's used to indicate what content will be copied.
