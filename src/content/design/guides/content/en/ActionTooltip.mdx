Here's the translated design guide source file:

The type of tooltip used when hovering over a button. It usually contains an explanation or additional information about the action that will occur after clicking the button. It's often used for buttons with a single icon to ensure users clearly understand the action it performs.

## Structure

1.  **Title** – The main and mandatory element of the tooltip, it briefly describes the primary action upon clicking the button. It's recommended to formulate the title text so it fits on a single line.
2.  **Description** – An optional element of the tooltip, providing additional information that clarifies the title.
3.  **Shortcut** – An optional element of the tooltip, a key combination that, when pressed, triggers the described action in the interface. It's used to teach users quick actions and speed up their interaction with the service.

## Variants

![Group 2087325956.png](/static/images/design/ActionTooltip/Variants.png)

1.  **Title only** – The most frequently used variant, where the tooltip briefly describes only the action itself. It's recommended to formulate the text to contain no more than 5 words.
2.  **Title and shortcut** – If an action has an assigned key combination, it's best to display it to assist the user.
3.  **Title and description** – If the action is complex and the title cannot be formulated concisely and unambiguously, it's recommended to add a description to provide additional information.
4.  **Title, description, and shortcut** – The maximum set for the component, for cases where all elements are necessary for the user to make a decision in the interface.

## Sizes

In the variant with a single title or a title and shortcut, the tooltip's width will adjust to the text. In variants with a description, its width is fixed at 300 px.

Padding in all variants: left and right – 12px, top and bottom – 8px.

Here's the translated design guide source file:

In the version with hotkeys, the spacing between the heading and the label is 8px.

In the version with a description (regardless of whether hotkeys are present or not), the spacing between the heading and the description is 2px.

## Position

The primary position of the tooltip relative to the button is below and centered, with a 4px gap between the elements.

If buttons are located at the left or right edge of the page, the tooltip aligns with the corresponding edge of the button.

If buttons are located at the bottom of the screen, the tooltip appears above, positioned to match the button's alignment – left-aligned, centered, or right-aligned.

## Timing

The delay for the tooltip's appearance and disappearance on hover can be adjusted based on its purpose. Most often, there is no delay for the tooltip to appear, or it has a small value – up to 250ms. The tooltip disappears instantly after the user moves the cursor away from the button.

If you anticipate that most users will understand the button without a hint, and the tooltip is shown in such cases for those who experience difficulty, the appearance delay can be increased to avoid annoying users with unnecessary elements.
