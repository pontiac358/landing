With a changelog, the service team can inform users about changes that have occurred.

The changelog is displayed once when the service is opened. The ability to reopen the changelog is not provided; if necessary, it can be implemented independently.

Since the changelog is displayed in a modal window, the rules for closing and scaling applicable to modal windows apply to it.

## Elements

The changelog is an `M` size modal window with posts arranged in chronological order. Each post has:

1. publication date;
2. a `New` [label](https://gravity-ui.com/design/guides/label) (optional);
3. a title;
4. an image (optional);
5. text;
6. an action [button](https://gravity-ui.com/design/guides/button) (optional).

### Publication Date

By the publication date, the user will be able to understand when a particular change in the service occurred. By default, the date is displayed in the `DD Mon YYYY` format, but other date formats can be used, taking into account the service's locale.

### Label

The `New` label is used to mark new posts. Which posts are considered new and should be marked with this label is determined by the service. It is possible to use other wording in the text, different from `New`.

### Title

The post title is used for a brief description of the change in the service. The title can be of any length. It is not recommended to:

- use titles that take up more than one line (containing more than 70 characters), as this degrades text readability;
- duplicate the news text in the title.

The `text-subheader-3` style is used for the title. The use of other text styles is not provided.

### Image

The image is optional and has fixed dimensions of 516x240 px. You can use JPG and PNG files as images; GIF images and video files are not supported. The image is used when it's necessary to illustrate the topic of the post. A single image is used for both light and dark interface themes.

If you upload an image exceeding 516x240 px, it will be scaled and centered along the longer side.

Considering retina displays, it's recommended to upload images scaled up by 2 times on each side, i.e., 1032x480 px.

### Text

After the image, the post text follows, which can be of arbitrary length. It is not recommended to:

- Use very long texts (over 500 characters). If it's not possible to shorten the text to the recommended length, you can add links to documentation within the text or create a transition to the full post text by clicking a button after the text.
- Create subheadings. Since the recommended text length doesn't imply it will be too long, additional block separation with subheadings is not required.

The `text-body-1` style is used for the text. The use of other text styles is not provided, but formatting is possible: creating bulleted and numbered lists, strikethrough and underline text, as well as bold and italic emphasis.

### Action Button

The action button is optional and is located below the post text. It is used to navigate to the full post text.

Only `M` size buttons can be used. The button can be of any type, with or without an icon. It is recommended to use a single button type.

Multiple buttons are not provided.

### Other Elements

Below the modal window title, there can also be a `View full changelog` link leading to the changelog page; this can be a separate service page, a storybook, a third-party service with documentation, etc.

## Usage Recommendations

Changelog is applied:

- When it's necessary to inform the user about significant changes that have occurred in the service.
- When it's necessary to keep the user updated on minor changes. In this case, it's worth showing the changelog periodically and reporting all small changes since the last entry.
- When you want to remind the user about changes in the service and increase their awareness of previous releases.

It is not recommended:

- To use changelog for onboarding.
- To use changelog to inform the user about every minor change in the service.
