The corner radius for various controls can be overridden. The following variables are used for this:

- `--g-border-radius-xs: 3px`;
- `--g-border-radius-s: 5px`;
- `--g-border-radius-m: 6px`;
- `--g-border-radius-l: 8px`;
- `--g-border-radius-xl: 10px`;
- `--g-border-radius-2xl: 16px`.

Values can be overridden in the **variables**.

Variables are used in controls of corresponding sizes. Changing the variable's value will change the corner radius for all controls of the same size. The controls affected by this variable are listed in the Figma library on the Branding page. Different controls have different size ranges, which is why the sets of controls may not match. For example, labels do not have sizes starting from `L` and larger, so variables starting from `--g-border-radius-l` are not used in this component and do not affect its appearance.

For `check-button`, the corner radii of the nested element depend on tokens and are calculated using the formula "token value – 3", where 3 is the distance between the inner and outer elements. In the current version, calculations need to be performed manually, and then the results should be entered into the tokens:
